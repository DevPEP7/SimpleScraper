# SimpleScraper v0.3: The Flexible Data Extractor

SimpleScraper v0.3 is a powerful and flexible Python tool for extracting data from single web pages. Born as a core logic generated by an AI assistant (`AutoDev v0.1`), this script has been upgraded to surgically extract the information you need (titles, links, specific tag content) and save it to a standard CSV file.

Ideal for: SEO Analysis, Content Research, Link Discovery, and Data Archiving.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Flexible Extraction:** You specify the HTML tag you want to extract (`h2`, `p`, `li`, etc.).
*   **Comprehensive Link Report:** Extracts all links (`<a>` tags) present on the page.
*   **CSV Output:** All results are saved to a `scraping_results.csv` file for easy import into Excel or Google Sheets.
*   **Error Handling:** Detects and reports common errors like 404, Timeout, or connection issues.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

To run the scraper, ensure you have:

1.  **Python 3.x** installed.
2.  The necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
üöÄ How to Run SimpleScraper v0.3
Download the source code (e.g., simplescraper_v03.py) from this repository.
Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
Execute the program: python simplescraper_v03.py
The program will guide you, asking for the URL to analyze and the name of the HTML tag you wish to extract (e.g., h2).
The results will be printed to the screen and saved to the scraping_results.csv file in the same directory.
